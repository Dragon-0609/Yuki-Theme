## Configuration

You can access the settings menu by clicking `Settings` button. Here's some fields, that you can set:

- [Path to PascalABC.NET](#path-to-pascalabcnet)
- [Active Scheme](#active-scheme)
- [Remember Active Scheme](#remember-active-scheme)
- [Ask if there are other themes in PascalABC directory](#ask-if-there-are-other-themes-in-pascalabc-directory)
- [Do action, if there are other themes](#do-action-if-there-are-other-themes)
- [Setting Mode](#setting-mode)
- [Check Update](#check-update)

#### Path to PascalABC.NET:
It's necessary to export the scheme to the IDE.

#### Active Scheme
It will be shown in next program opening.

#### Remember Active Scheme
It sets current scheme to active scheme, so it will be shown in next program opening

#### Ask if there are other themes in PascalABC directory
It asks on exporting scheme to the IDE, if there are other themes in `Highlighting` directory inside `PascalABC.NET` directory

#### Do action if there are other themes 
If you uncheck `Ask if there are other themes in PascalABC directory`, the selected action will be done. There're 3 actions:
- Delete (old scheme)
- Import and Delete (old scheme)
- Ignore (old scheme)

#### Setting Mode
This checkbox is for custom coloring. It has 2 values: `Light` and `Advanced`.
`Light` is the easiest way to change colors. It shows only main syntax colors and applies to duplicate colors by itself. There're 4 types of comment colors. In `Light` mode it's shown as 1 color.
`Advanced` shows all colors. Also, there're duplicate colors. For example: there're 4 colors for Comments and etc.

#### Check Update
If the checkbox is checked, the programm will check updates in every program run. If there's update, the program will notify you.
